A Todo app created with HTML & CSS.
JavaScript was used to manipulate the DOM and make the interaction with the app possible.

Thanks to this Todo app you can keep note of all your tasks!
You are able to add to the list as many "todos" as you want and mark them as done whenever you're indeed done with them!

If you change your mind and prefer to chill instead of washing your dishes, you can delete any tasks as well.
